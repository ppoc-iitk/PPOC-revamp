                    <p>
                        Rishi Sunak was sworn in as the first Asian British prime minister of the United Kingdom on 24
                        October 2022. In an unprecedented revolving door leading to Downing Street ( Residence & office
                        of the PM), Sunak is the fifth PM Britain has seen in the last six years. Political instability,
                        inflation, environmental hazards, energy crisis, probable bifurcation — nothing seems to be
                        going right for the once great Britain. Let's articulate the ingredients for such a mess in a
                        developed country and, towards the end, contemplate how our country has many of those still
                        standing 'intact.'
                    </p>
                    <p>It all started on 1 January 1973, when the UK became a member of the European Union( then EC )
                        under the leadership of Edward Heath, a Conservative party leader. Ironically enough, it was the
                        Tories (A colloquial term used for the Conservative party leaders) who rallied the UK out of the
                        Union, too, on 31 January 2021 under Boris Johnson. As is evident from the preceding statement,
                        there was always volatility in public and leadership opinions on the position of the UK in the
                        EU. Though, this was only truly realized in the 2016 referendum:- "Should the United Kingdom
                        remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?".
                        <br />
                        The then Prime Minister of the UK, David Cameron, staked his PM chair on 'stay.' In the
                        referendum, 51.89% voted in favor of leaving the EU (Leave), and 48.11% voted in favor of
                        remaining a member of the EU (Remain). An outrageous verdict laid out the basis for a
                        troublesome political scenario.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Cameron resigned soon after, remarking on the need and utility of the EU for Britain in his last
                        speech at the podium of Number 10 ( Residence of the PM ). Theresa May, the second female prime
                        minister sworn in. Touted to be indecisive and confused, she needed help to negotiate a formal
                        approvable deal for Brexit in the Parliament. In an ugly position, she was to balance out the
                        moderates and fundamentalists in the Parliament. The predicament was real — a hard Brexit or
                        not? Her resilience had a number; after three rejections in the Parliament, she resigned in
                        2019.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Brexit, the number one priority of the Tory manifesto, led them to be victorious in the 2019
                        general elections. Boris Johnson was sworn in, and after two years of negotiations and drafting,
                        proposed a Brexit deal that was accepted by all, and finally, Britain exited. While this was
                        expected to be the closure of all woes for the Britons, Johnson's portfolio had humanitarian
                        stains. Partygate scandals, sexual assault allegations against his ministers(Chris Pincher),
                        party-before-country mentality (Owen Peterson scandal), and rising inflation — his simmering
                        scandalous cauldron soon boiled up, and he resigned after being unable to hold together his
                        cabinet as the ministers resigned in unprecedented numbers.
                    </p>
                    <p>Then comes Liz Truss, Britain's least favorite, shortest-serving prime minister. She bestowed
                        Britain with her radical "bold" financial policies in her leadership. Supposedly the only thing
                        Britain did not need. She introduced tax cuts worth 45 billion pounds, the largest ever, with
                        the plan to promote investment. Further, she planned on borrowing at least 60 billion pounds to
                        finance a plan to cap high energy prices for households and businesses. This master plan would
                        basically peak the already sky-high debts of the country. Despite contentions, she went ahead
                        with the plan. Voila! As a result, the pound (UK's currency) fell drastically. It was valued at
                        $1.03, the record lowest against the US dollar. Dysfunction in the market continued as she
                        refrained from withdrawing. However, the pressure from the opposition forced her to repeal the
                        policies, the key highlight of her 45-day stint as a prime minister.</p>
                    <p>While the whole world anticipates the next staggering turn of events in this story, all Britain
                        wants is a boring prime minister who goes by the book and leads them out of this unprecedented
                        delusional disorder. <br />
                        Despite intense political turbulence, Britain exhibits signs of a healthy democracy. A democracy
                        where leaders rule for the people, not for their lust for power; where ministers can oppose
                        their prime minister; where a healthy opposition and media check the government; and where
                        ministers are sacked for lack of ethics and discipline. In no way is the present UK a model to
                        look up to, but indeed these conclusions can help us reflect on our country and contemplate the
                        hypocrisy of the 'normalcy' in our political system. </p>
