                        Food safety, as described by the United Nations Committee on global meals security, is the way

                        secure, and nutritious meals that meet their food choices and dietary needs for an energetic and
                        healthful life. (“Food Security - Agriculture” 2019)

                            In the 1950s and 1960s, food security was defined as sufficient protein and energy (amount

                            In the 1980s, the importance of micronutrients for a balanced and nutritious diet (food
                            quality) was recognized.

                            Even with adequate intake in the 1990s, nutrient absorption problems (e.g., diarrhea) or
                            excessive nutrient loss (e.g., respiratory infections) can impair food utilization.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Food security is an essential determinant of nutrition and health.

                        <p>The reasons for hunger and food insecurity vary from country to country, but generally, it is
                            a result of conflict, poverty, economic shocks such as hyperinflation and rising commodity
                            prices, and environmental shocks such as flooding or drought. (“Global food crisis”, n.d.)

                                The conflict in Ukraine sent global food prices skyrocketing. A third of the world's
                                wheat supply comes from Ukraine or Russia. Ukraine supplies the world with sunflower
                                oil, barley, corn, and fertilizers. But the ongoing conflict means that fields will not
                                be ready, crops will not be planted, and fertilizers will not be available.

                                    futures contracts traded in Chicago, a worldwide wheat hub. The price hovered in
                                    nearly double digits until it began to fall in mid-June. Wheat changed into buying
                                    and selling at just over $8 a bushel on August 1st. After the preliminary surprise
                                    of the invasion, rising costs discouraged a few nations from buying wheat, lowering

                                agreement was reached to open export corridors so that some of the grain trapped by the
                                war could be shipped around the world. For the first time in more than five months, a
                                ship loaded with grain left a port in the Odessa region of Ukraine on her August 1st.

                        <p>Regardless of good sized development made over the last few decades in lowering hunger,
                            almost 800 million humans are chronically undernourished as of 2015. An anticipated 161
                            million youngsters below the age of 5 are stunted. at the equal time, 500 million people are
                            obese. two billion people lack the essential micronutrients they need to live a wholesome
                            lifestyles. The FAO estimates that food manufacturing will want to boom via 60 percentage by
                            means of 2050 to meet increasing demand driven with the aid of populace growth and dietary

                        <p>It is not enough to have enough food produced globally to meet demand – there is now enough
                            food produced globally, but there are still nearly 800 million hungry people – but that
                            everyone has access to it in the right quantity and quality at all times. According to the
                            United Nations, in 2015, 836 million people in the world still lived in extreme poverty
                            (less than US$1.25/day). And according to the International Fund for Agricultural
                            Development (IFAD), at least 70 percent of the very poor live in rural areas, most of them
                            partially (or entirely) dependent on agriculture1 for their livelihoods. An estimated 500
                            million small farms in the developing world support nearly 2 billion people, and in Asia and
                            sub-Saharan In Africa, these small farms produce about 80 percent of the food consumed.

                    <p>For example, the United Nations has set 17 Sustainable Development Goals to be achieved by 2030.
                        The second goal is to achieve food security and better nutrition, end hunger and promote
                        sustainable agriculture.<br />
                        So it is up to every individual, family, group, organization, corporation, institution and
                        government to achieve food security by 2030. Most institutions and countries have not done much,
                        but there are hopes for food security. (“Causes, Effects and Solutions to Food Insecurity (Lack
                        of Access to Food)”, n.d.)

                        <li style="font-weight: 700;">Reduce Food Waste</li>
                        <p>Food is wasted primarily through inefficient preparation, uneven or poor roads, overly
                            selective customers, and inadequate storage facilities. When storage facilities are
                            improved, and food is properly prepared, less food is wasted, resulting in safer
                            communities. As mentioned above, FAO reports that about 1.3 billion tonnes of food are
                            wasted worldwide yearly.</p>
                        <li style="font-weight: 700;"> Reduce the Risk of Commercialising
                        </li>
                        <p>Levels of food insecurity are reduced when food is grown to feed communities and nations.
                            Farmers can produce more food and cash crops if there are enough food crops on the market.
                            If enough food is on the market, the risk of commercializing food is low. Governments should
                            also implement programs to let farmers know there is enough food for everyone.
                        </p>
                        <li style="font-weight: 700;">Improve Trade Policies</li>
                        <p>Some farmers cannot feed their communities due to unfair trade policies. Giant companies have
                            already entered and commercialized food, making it difficult for small farmers to bring
                            their produce to market. Governments, therefore, need to improve these policies and ensure
                            that participation is fair for all.</p>
                        <li style="font-weight: 700;">Close the Yield Gap</li>
                        <p>Most of our farmland is depleted of its natural level of fertility and cannot produce as much
                            as it did years ago. To fill the gap, governments, therefore,sible agricultural institutions
                            have developed strategies and programs to improve crop yields, especially local methods of
                            sustainable agricultural intensification, such as land management and soil
                            improvement.<br />
                            Land conversion should be avoided as it encroaches on natural habitats and forests, affects
                            biodiversity and wildlife, and increases greenhouse gas emissions. The strategy or set of
                            the program should ensure that food is available to all and that wildlife and forests are
                            not affected.

                        in India total rice planted area has declined by 13% so far this season due to a lack of
                        rainfall in many areas like west Bengal and Uttar Pradesh. The Indian government has already
                        curbed wheat and sugar exports to safeguard food security and control local prices within the

                            meals disaster unfolding against the backdrop of severe wheat shortage.</p>
                        <p>As wheat production dips, the middle could reduce procurement and encourage open market sales
                            to reduce expenses, accordingly supporting preserve meal inflation on top of things.
                        </p>
                        <p>By giving a free hand to the private sector to export and not releasing buffer stocks from
                            the Food Corporation of India (FCI) godowns, the government can help Indian farmers realize
                            higher prices and the world meet its wheat deficit.</p>
                        <p>The government should also promote coarse grains like jowar, bajra, kodo, raagi, and other
                            millets in mid-day meals or government welfare programs because of their high nutritional
                            value.</p>
