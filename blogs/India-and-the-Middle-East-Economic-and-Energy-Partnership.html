            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
              Energy Security is one of the significant pillars of securing national interest. Amid the crisis, we have seen how Oil and natural gas can be used as a weapon of war to suffice one's interest. So, it becomes necessary to establish good relations with countries that fulfill our requirements for energy and have a stronghold in the changing world order. India is the third highest consumer of Oil, and about 52.7 % of the oil import come from the middle east(i). The Middle East, or West Asia, should not be merely viewed as a gas station; it has profound geopolitical and geoeconomic significance as India shares deep civilizational ties, cultural exchanges, and historical links
            </p>
            <h2>Historical Links</h2>
            <p>
              There are historical links with the region seals from Mesopotamia have been found in Harrapan sites. The exchange between the people increased during medieval times. Trade between the two regions flourished as Arab traders arrived on the Indian shores much before the Muslim invasion of India. The first ever maritime trade recorded was between Indus Valley Civilisation and Dilmun. Dilmun traders established a monopoly in trade between India and Mesopotamia. Later the trade between the two regions was dominated mainly by the Arabians from Yemen and Oman. India was a giant exporter of goods such as spices, textiles, etc. Before the discovery of Oil in the Gulf, the region was the exporter of pearls. After the discovery of oil in the region, the nature of trade between the middle east and India changed, from a leading exporter the  Indian subcontinent is now a major importer of goods, especially oil. 
            </p>
            <h2>
              Energy Security
            </h2>
            <p>
              Energy security refers to the provision of the energy resources necessary for the proper functioning of the state's economy and its citizens' well-being in optimal quantity and at a fair price by applying adequate measures to achieve long-term stability. The Middle East being very rich in Oil, is of great importance and will remain important for a long time until the economy shifts to an alternative form of energy. The country enjoys an abundance of traditional and non-traditional energy sources but these sources are insufficient for India's growing needs. Therefore the subcontinent imports the majority of the energy. The demand for crude Oil grew from around 40% in the 1990s to 70% in 2011. The majority of the import in 2012 from the middle east was about 64%. Looking at the growth patterns of the Indian subcontinent the import is expected to rise to 91% in 2032(ii). Thus to secure the best prices and energy security, the country has concluded several short and long terms contracts at the government level and, to a lesser extent, through private companies.
            </p>
            <p>
              The major oil companies of the region - ARAMCO and ADNOC are deepening their contacts with Indian companies both public and private. ARAMCO and Reliance industries are developing strategic partnerships and an investment by the former in the west coast refinery and petrochemical projects in Maharashtra. Indian companies like ONGC have also engaged in oil extraction, refinery, and technical support, creating stronger economic interdependence.
            </p>
            <h2>Remittance</h2>
            <p>
              As per the Population Division of Economic and Social Affairs report titled International migration 2022 Highlights, India has the largest diaspora population in the world. According to MEA, most NRIs, almost 7.6 million, live in the Middle East. The main reason for migration into the Gulf is the job opportunities available there. Apart from a job for millions of people diaspora living in the middle east is very beneficial for the Indian economy. The benefit is in the form of remittance that this huge diaspora sends back to India. This money adds to national income and ensures capital inflow in a country. India consistently remains the largest remittance receiver in the world. In 2021 India received a remittance of about 87 billion dollars, far more than other countries(iii).In 2022 India received over 83 billion dollars which constituted about 3.1% of India's GDP in that year, with the majority of that remittance coming from the Gulf. 
            </p>
            <h2>Recent Events and Future Ahead </h2>
            <p>
              Last year, foreign ministers of India, Israel, UAE, and the US met virtually to form what they called an "International forum for economic cooperation," which is being termed the new quad(iv). India's involvement in new grouping reflects a shift in foreign policies. The advantages India will gain from this grouping are a shift towards a regional approach, which will deepen relations with the participating members. Furthermore, there was resentment in the Arab world as India received a diplomatic storm because of the derogatory remarks made by the BJP spokesperson over the prophet Mohammed. However, the ties and historical links between the region are strong enough that the relations are not expected to weaken. Looking forward, it is too early to conclude about the strategic significance of the new groupings in the region. India should also maintain a distance from the tensions at the border within west Asia. India should also engage actively with Iran to maintain healthy relations. Ultimately one of the routes of India's prosperity passes through the middle east so the subcontinent should cement its relations with west-Asian nations.
