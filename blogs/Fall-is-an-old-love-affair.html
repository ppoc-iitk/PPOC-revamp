            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                August 15, 1947, seems like long time ago. It indeed was. Seven-and-half decades might be a long period of your time, though it is but a fleeting moment in the history. World was different then. India was different then. The Indian economy was different then.
                Money is not an immoral creature but it's worth keep fluctuating with the society and its economic conditions. One rupee in 1947 is not the same as one rupee today, both in terms of appearance . The worth of a country's currency is linked with its economic conditions and policies.
            </p>
            <p>
                This article attempts to give statistics and reasons of falling rupee value and suggests various necessary steps and strategies to prevent this decline in the rupee value.
                Since the British were ruling India before its independence, the rupee was tied to British Pound as Britain was largest trading partner at that point, which kept the value constant for a brief time. As per reports, 1 pound was worth 13 INR from 1947 until 1966. The agreement came to an end in 1966, also rupee rupee was devalued and pegged to the US dollar at a rate of Rs 7.5 = 1 dollar.
                
            </p>
            <h2>WHY DOLLAR !!</h2>
            <p>
                The US dollar is one of the foremost used currencies and holds great influence in international trade. And its value has always been on the upper side, determining the worth of other currencies around world. As a result, value  of the Indian currency, like that of other currencies, is set by comparing it to the dollar.
                Moreover, it's easier to trade with dollar than other currencies, and thus dollar emerged as a significant means of trade after World War I.
                Let's discuss the major events one-by-one ...
            </p>
            <h3>1) Economic crisis of 1966</h3>
            <p>
                Indian currency began with devaluation in 1949 because of the devaluation of British monetary unit From 1950, India continuously bumped into trade deficits which increased continuously till the 60's. GoI also had the problem of deficit because of which they were unable to borrow money. Due to this, the government issued bonds to the RBI thus resulting in inflation due to increased monetary resource. Also,during the same time, India witnessed two major wars namely Indo-China(1962) and India-Pak(1965) war due to which defence budget increased exponentially. In 1965-66, India was also hit with a drought further adding to the issues. All these series of events finally led to depreciation of rupee by Indian government by 36.5%
            </p>
            <h3>2)Economic crisis of 1991</h3>
            <p>
                By late 1990, rupee was trading at 1 USD = 17.32INR. But because of the geopolitical situation evolving around 90's, India was stuck in the midst of another slump. USSR was one among the leading export hubs for India but due to collapse of the USSR during 1988-91, Indian exports fell drastically. This includes doubling of crude prices because of Gulf war leadind to increase in government expenditure and drop in revenue. With foreign exchanges depleted to the extent that it can barely finance three weeks of imports, government had no option left but to devalue the rupee by almost 20% and get out of the current fixed rate of exchange to floating rate of exchange plus liberalization of Indian economy.
            </p>
            <h3>3)Revaluation in 2000's and global Economic crisis 2008</h3>
            <p>
                Following economic reforms of 1991, rupee consolidated in coming years and remained within the range of $44-48 during 2000-2007. This happened due to sustained FDI inflow in these years. Rupee even plunged to the low of 1$ = Rs.39 in late 2007 resulting in problems for exporters due to cost disadvantage. But the trend completely reversed in 2008, when world was struck with an economic crisis because of fall of the main investment bank Lehman Brothers which prompt all investors to take away money from stock exchange. This resulted to crash in US market due to which rupee depreciated to the level of Rs.49.
            </p>
            <h3>4)2013 Depreciation</h3>
            <p>Due to lack of economic reforms, decrease in FDI, rising inflation and slow growth rate, rupee again began to lose it's value in 2013. Rupee almost fell 15% in the span of 5 months to fall to the level of 1$ = INR 62-63.</p>
            <h2>2014-2018</h2>
            <p>
                The USD vs INR rate of exchange has been greatly volatile during the last 5 years i.e. from 2014 to 2018. The exchange rate was at it's peak in October 2018 (73.96) and was lowest in April 2014 (60.315). The key reasons are:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    During 2014-2016, the Indian rupee’s average value against the US Dollar dropped continuously. It was due to the boom in North American oil production and crashes in the price of oil.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Trade war between America and China leads to the outflow of dollar in Indian market. Rupee was already in pressure of high petroleum prices.
                </li>
                <li>
                    RBI has not intervened aggressively to support the domestic currency.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Demonetisation: After demonetization of Indian currency in 2016, Rupee has become weaker by 2.66% against US Dollar ($) from 66.40 to 68.17 INR per unit US Dollar also Rupee has become weaker against some popular currencies like British pound, Canadian dollar and Hong Kong Dollar too.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Strong governments, economic weakness: Whenever a government gets very strong at the Centre there appears to be an inverse correlation-ship between strong governments and economic process. Ruling party legislators begin to think they know best. They try to interfere with society, industry and even policy. The result, economic growth suffers invariably.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h2>COVID 19 Pandemic</h2>
            <p>
                Covid 19 outbreak leads to worldwide economic crisis. Indian economy contracted by 7.3% after covid outbreak. This is the worst decline ever observed since the ministry had started compiling GDP stats quarterly in 1996. As the government announced such a lockdown policy, various economic activities have been stopped suddenly. The financial market of India is witnessed sharp volatility as a result of the disruption of the global market . As a result of the fall out in the global financial market, the Indian stock market also witnesses sharp volatility which result in nifty soared from 7800 in March 2020 to 18500 October 2021.
            </p>
            <h2>Current Scenario</h2>
            <p>
                Currently, indian rupee has lost over 6% against US dollar since the start of 2022 despite changing monteary rules and policies.
            </p>
            <h3>1. Crude oil prices</h3>
            <p>Recently, the decision taken by organisation of arab petroleum exporting countries(OAPEC) to reduce oil production and Persian gulf nations to hike crude oil prices led India to borrow more foreign currency which ends up in devalue of rupee.
            </p>
            <h3>2. Foreign institutional investor(FII)</h3>
            <p>Increase in interest rates in india and spike in bond yields in US and UK led FII to pull out Rs 2.15 lakh crore within the first five months of 2022 in cash market segment which is more than what they bought in 12 years between 2009 to 2021.</p>
            <iframe title="FOREIGN INSTITUTIONAL INVESTMENT IN INDIA" aria-label="Column Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-hlsC5" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/hlsC5/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="600"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();</script>
            <h3>3. US federal's rate hike</h3>
            <p>Since march 2022, us federal reserve has been raising its standard interest rate,which led investors to look for advanced yields by drawing capital back to US.</p>
            <h3>4. Russia-Ukraine war</h3>
            <p>Whenever war happens,the global import-export cycle is impacted,as a result gobal crude oil prices have touched the peak in 2022,this impacts the value of all commodities because the supply chain becomes costly</p>
            <h3>5. Current account deficit</h3>
            <p> Due to affected supply chain ,india's continuously widening trade deficit is a major factor in depreciation of rupee.India has seen a increase in exports and imports in june 2022 of 23.52% and 57.55% respectively which ends in increase of CAD of about 172.72% as compared to june 2021</p>
            <p style="text-align: center">
                <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/xTm2NSSZ/download.png" alt="">
            </p>
            <h2>Future Predictions</h2>
            <p>Rupee is seeing a downfall from last few months and the situation is looking no brighter in coming time due to prolonged Russia-Ukraine war which has catalysed the crude oil prices to an average of $110-115 per barrel. Possible rate hikes, higher inflation and slowdown in growth. many leading analyst firms from Nomura holdings Inc. to Bloomberg have predicted a further 4% drop in rupee prices from current all time low of 1$= 78Rs . this is mainly due to increased oil prices and US central bank raising interest rate due to which investors will push their money into the US further increasing pressure on India's growth.</p>
            <h2>Strategy</h2>
            <h3>1. Decreasing current account deficit</h3>
            <p>This includes increasing exports and decreasing imports both in terms of cost and volume. As major part of india's import come from OIL.We can reduce dependence of oil by switching to renewable energy and increasing ethanol blending to 20%. exports can be increased by focusing on manufacturing which can be done by making business friendly environment and providing better infrastructure to attract companies.
                Government should act actively regarding this issue and ensure regular trade activities to safeguard the current accounts of the country which will increase chances of value of rupee becoming better against US dollar.</p>
                <p style="text-align: center">
                    <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/dVwbxkz2/download-1.png" alt="">
                </p>
                <h3>2. Government reforms</h3>
            <p>this is necessary step in right direction as no developing country can move forward without reforms. In india, government should focus on ease of doing business by making land acquisition easy, simplifying tax system and less compliances. uniformity in laws across all states would also help in making india a preferable destination for businesses. this can be achieved by framing a common national policy instead of states policy. better infrastructure is also required to attract more companie. this can be done by rolling more schemes like PM Gati Shakti yojna.</p>
            <h3>3. Increasing FDI Inflow</h3>
            <p>FDI plays a pivotal role in many country's growth story, for eg- CHINA. FDI stimulates economic development and results in increased employment opportunities which help in strengthening country's economy which results in better currency value. FDI can be increased by following methods-
                <ol>
                    <li>Higher GDP growth rate</li>
                    <li>Investing more in capital infrastructure and framing industrial policy to attract investors.
                        (iii)good governence </li>
                        <li>As of now, foriegn investors could only invest in 5, 10, 15 year government bonds. thus introducing corporate bonds of tenure less than a year will attract foriegn investors . Also RBI can increase the borrowing limit for private companies who seek loans from foreign nations.</li>
                        <li>Pump Primimg: it involves pumping small amounts of government funds into a depressed economy to encourage growth</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: center">
                <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/J7xsGZMg/download-2.png" alt="">
            </p>
            <h3>4. In-country cashflow</h3>
            <p>Cash flow within country can be increased by decreasing Repo rates ensuring easy loans and people will have more money in hand which in turn results in GDP as well</p>
            <h3>Abolition of Monopolies</h3>
            <p>Establishing a proper framework, encouraging competition by safeguarding companies at initial stages and start-ups who compete in open market against big enterprises. For eg- ONDC , developed for e-commerce. This system encourages level playing field for small retailers, lower the barrier of entry and fixing non-competitive behaviour of big commerce firms. This also keeps check on Big Tech companies from violating consumer rights</p>
            <h3>6. Trade transaction in INR</h3>
            <p>Indian rupee is hanging around 79.5 against US dollar currently . however rupee has not weakened against every currency ( like it's up 6% against Euro this year ). since dollar is the global currency, we still have to pay more for imports. additional arrangement for invoicing, payment, and settlement of imports/ exports in INR rather than dollar aiming to promote exports from india to increase the interest of global trading community in INR. this may also allow india to do transaction with russia which is cut off SWIFT. thus taking measures to increase trade in INR will help india preserve its foriegn reserves eventually increasing rupee demand and value globally. </p>
            <h3>7: Attracting NRI money to India</h3>
            <p>RBI can lift the cap on the interest rates on dollar deposits which banks offer to NRIs and foreign depositors . Thus , enabling banks to offer higher deposit rates, to incentivize foreigners and NRIs to deposit their money with Indian banks. this will increase the supply of dollar in India's economy and will weaken the dollar.</p>
