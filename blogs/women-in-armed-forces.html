                    <h2>Indian Army</h2>
                    <p>The inclusion of women in the Indian Armed Forces started in the year 1888 with the formation of the Indian Military Nursing Service during the Colonial period. With the outbreak of World War I and II, Military Nurses actively participated in the war leading to many deaths and imprisonment. Post India’s independence, military nurses were granted regular commissions as per the Army Act, 1950. The Government of India issued Army Instruction 274/50 to set the terms and conditions of the grant of regular commission in the Military Nursing Service (MNS) forming part of the regular army, subject to the Army Act 1950, and the members of the erstwhile IMNS stood absorbed as ofﬁcers in MNS. All women corps in the MNS was brought under the Army Rules along with every other service of the regular army such as Army Medical Corps and Army Dental Corps under the 1954 Army Rules, which constitutes the Armed Forces Medical Services(AFMS). Women have been serving in the Armed Forces for more than 100 years since their induction in the nursing corps. It was not until 1992 that the role of women extended to other ﬁelds in the armed forces. </p>
                    
                    <p>Women were granted a commission in the following corps from the year 1992 under the short service com-mission for 5 years in:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Army Service Corps</li>
                        <li>Army Ordnance Corps</li>
                        <li>Army Education Corps</li>
                        <li>Judge Advocate General Department </li>
                        
                    </ul>
                    <p>In 1996, SSC of 5 years was extended to 10 years. To ensure gender equality in the defense service, entry of women was opened in the Electrical and Mechanical Engineering Corps as well as the Intelligence Corps. Further, in the year 2004, the tenure of service of women in the forces was increased to 14 years. Women are inducted into various corps such as AOS, JAG, and EME constituting 3.80% of the Indian Army workforce. Earlier Sainik Schools that prepare future armed force ofﬁcers were open only for boys. In 2018, the Government opened it for the girls. This is the steppingstone for girls to prepare for their careers as defense personnel. This decision was taken with the objective of the government toward greater inclusiveness and gender parity, thus enabling greater participation of women in the Forces . Till the year 2018, women were recruited only as ofﬁcers in the Indian Army. In the year 2019, the then Defense Minister on behalf of the Government of India announced the recruitment of 20%, that would be around 1700, women for the post of military police, opening up a new avenue for women and boosting their morale . In the year 2019, there were 1561 women Ofﬁcers in the Indian Army as compared to 50in the year 1993.</p>

                    <h2> Indian Air Force</h2>
                    
                    
                    <p>
                        Indian Air Force is the only branch that inducts women in all roles. Indian AirForce started the induction of women as transport and helicopter pilots in 1994. Since then, women have been playing a major role in maintaining the high morale of the Indian Air Force by actively participating in an assortment of welfare and social activities of air force bases. Furthermore, a futuristic progressive and modern approach is where women will be playing a major role. On the implementation of Judgment given by the Delhi High Court in the year 2010 for grant of permanent commission to the short service commission Ofﬁcers, 41 women were granted permanent commission. Women ofﬁcers in the Indian Air Force are shouldering their duties as pilots, navigators, technical ofﬁcers, and ground duty branch ofﬁcers along with their male counterparts. In 2015, a decision was taken by the Indian Government to induct women in the ﬁghter stream. In the year 2016, the ﬁrst batch of women ofﬁcers was commissioned in the ﬁghter stream. Women Ofﬁcers of the Indian Air Force has been part of major Operation like the Balakot Airstrikes as ﬁghter Controllers. The initial phases of the twenty-ﬁrst century showed a gradual increase in the recruitment of women in the Indian Air Force. The Table 4 includes women in the corps other than medical services. Though the recruitment of women in the above ﬁgure shows a steep decline in the current years, the total recruitment of women in the over-all Corps shows there is an increase in women’s induction. The data published by the government of India showed the total percentage is 13.09 in the year 2019, while in 2010 it was only 6.7%. Over 1900 women ofﬁcers including 8 ﬁghter pilots were inducted in Indian Air Force in the year 2019, while before 2015 there were no women in the ﬁghter stream.

                    <h2>Indian Navy</h2>
                    
                    <p>Indian Navy has been inducting women since 1992 as short service commissioned ofﬁcers in some of the few branches. Indian Navy has opened doors for women to join the force from3 branches in the year 1992 to 11 branches in the year 2019. Today, women are inducted in diversiﬁed branches such as observer,law logistics, education, pilot, and others.Recently, the Government of India has given women permanent commission in education branch, law, and naval architecture. After26 years of women recruitment in the Navy,India got its ﬁrst woman pilot in the Naval Armament Inspection Branch in the year 2019 . The ﬁgure for women intake in the force has improved since 1994 when only two women were working in the force. Eventually, the number has increased to 54 in the year 2019, showing signs of improvement. The overall percentage of women recruited in the Indian navy has increased from 3% in the year 2010 to 6% in the year 2019.In the year 2017 all-woman crew of six members was sent on a voyage named Navika Sagar Paprika on INVS Tarini and they successfully circumnavigated the globe. Women are coming to the forefront in all the sectors while the government has been introducing various schemes toup lift women in these ﬁelds.</p>

                    <p> Apart from the other wings, Indian Coast Guards as an armed force was setup in 1978. Indian Coast Guard is mandated to protect the Maritime Zone of India. Women are recruited in the Coast Guard for general duty as pilot and law ofﬁcers. Though Coast Guard is an independent armed force under the Ministry of Defence, however, it works in close cooperation with the Indian naval wing. Indian Coast Guard has been training women since 1997 as a permanent appointee as Assistant Commandant in General Duty . Coast Guard is the only force under the Ministry of Defence to give permanent commission to women since its inception. Earlier, the force recruited women in every ﬁeld except frontline guarding. In the year 2017, the Indian Coast has become the ﬁrst force under the Ministry of Defence to deploy women ofﬁcers in combat roles for patrolling India’s vast and vulnerable maritime zone. It is a major step toward the empowerment of women taken by the Government .Graph shows that the number of women recruitment in the Indian Coast Guard has strengthened every year since its establishment.The ﬁgure shows that only in the year 2015 less number of women ofﬁcers were recruited in the Force. The number of recruitment has dropped down to 3 in the year 2018 as compared to 43 in the year 2012. However, the recently recruited number shows that 133 women were inducted in the year 2019, which is quite a high number than the previous years. Women of Coast Guard were also major members of governing KV Hovercraft ship patrolling on the Pakistan–Bangladesh Inter-national border. The Force has debuted an all-women crew, several times for such patrolling missions. Women in the Coast Guard are trained to handle all missions that fall under the Coast Guard Charter that includes boarding of suspicious vessels and contraband smugglers in the high seas .</p>
