                    <h2>Major points from the draft</h2>
                    <p>There shall be an Authority to be known as the National Capital Civil
                    Service Authority to exercise the powers conferred on, and discharge the functions assigned to it under this Part.<br>
                    (2) The Authority, referred to in sub-section (1), shall consist of the following Members, namely:â€”
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>the Chief Minister of Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi, who shall be the Chairperson of the Authority, ex officio;</li>
                        <li>the Chief Secretary of Government of National Capital Territory of
                            Delhi, Member, ex officio; and
                            </li>
                        <li>the Principal Home Secretary, Government of National Capital Territory
                            of Delhi, who shall be the Member-Secretary to the Authority, ex officio.
                            </li>
                        <li>
                            All matters required to be decided by the Authority shall be decided by
majority of votes of the Members present and voting.

                        </li>  
                        <li>All recommendations of the Authority shall be authenticated by the
                            Member-Secretary.
                            </li>  
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h2>Explanations</h2>
                    <p>In case the Secretary to the Council of Ministers is of the opinion that the proposal considered and decided by the Council of Ministers is not in accordance with the provisions of any law for the time being in force or any rules of procedure made under section 44, it shall be the duty of the Secretary to the Council of Ministers to bring it to the notice of the Lieutenant Governor for taking a decision thereon.
                    </p>
                    <p>Any matter which is likely to bring the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi into controversy with the Central Government or with any State Government, the Supreme Court of India or the High Court of Delhi and such other authorities as may be determined, the Secretary to the Department concerned shall, as soon as possible, bring it to the notice of the Lieutenant Governor, the Chief Minister 5 and the Chief Secretary in writing.</p>
                    <p>Delhi being the capital of India is administered by the President of Indiadirectly. Article 239AA of the Constitution provides for special provisions with respect to Union territory of Delhi. The said article provides for various functional and administrative networked issues balancing the participation of the Union Government in the affairs relating to the administration of Delhi in general, and particular, under the provisions contained in sub-clause (b) of clause (3) and clause (7) of the said article. Several important National and International institutions and authorities like the President, the Parliament, the Supreme Court, various constitutional functionaries, foreign diplomatic missions, international agencies, etc., are located in Delhi and high dignitaries from other nations pay official visits to Delhi, and in the national interest of the country, highest possible standards are required to be maintained in the administration and governance of the National Capital Territory of Delhi.</p>
                    <p> Any decision taken in respect of Delhi not only affects the residents of Delhi but also affects entire country and shall have the potential of putting the national reputation, image, credibility and prestige at stake in the international global spectrum and therefore, the entire nation is vitally interested in the governance of the National Capital Territory of Delhi. Delhi being the capital of India has a unique status and certain distinguished features and there is need to promote the national interests without compromising the aspirations of the residents of Delhi. Article 1 of the Constitution defines the territory of India, comprising of States and Union territories and article 1 read with article 239 provides that the Union territories are to be governed solely by the President.</p>

                    

                    <h2>Text</h2>
                    <p>With a view to give effect to the intent and purpose behind the provisions of article 239AA of the Constitution, a permanent authority, headed by the Chief Minister of Delhi along with the Chief Secretary, Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi and the Principal Secretary, Home, Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi, is being constituted to make recommendations to the Lieutenant Governor regarding matters concerning transfer postings, vigilance and other matters. This would balance the interest of the nation with the interest of the Union territory of Delhi in the administration of the capital to the manifestation of the will of the people reposed in the Central Government as well as the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi. The Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Bill, 2023, inter alia, provides for amendments to the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi Act, 1991(hereinafter referred to as the Act)â€”</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>to define the terms "Lieutenant Governor" and "Minister"</li>
                        <li>to insert a new Part IV-A in the Act relating to the maintenance of democratic and administrative balance in the governance of the National Capital Territory of Delhi, which provides forâ€”
                            <ul>
                                <li>definitions of certain terms used in Part IV-A</li>
                                <li>Public Service Commissions for the National Capital Territory of Delhi
                                    </li>
                                <li>empowering the Central Government to make rules in connection with the affairs of the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi including the functions, terms and other conditions of service of officers and employees</li>
                                <li>constitution of the National Capital Civil Service Authority, the powers and functions of the Authority and other incidental matters</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>for removal of difficulties by a Presidential Order, in case of any difficulty arises in giving effect to the provisions of newly inserted Part IV-A in the Act</li>
                        <li> to repeal the National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Ordinance, 2023.</li>   
                    </ul>
                    <p>The provisions of the Bill are being brought into force from the 19th May, 2023 i.e., the date of coming into force of the said Ordinance.</p>
                    <p><strong>Highlights of Draft end here.</strong></p>

                    <h3>Inferences</h3>
                    <p>Inferences
                        Major points understood by me
                        </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Though legal and in accordance with the power given to GoI,the said bill reduces the powers of Elected Delhi Government and gives more power to LG and OFficers posted.</li>
                        <li>The major reasons given behind the move by GoI Home minister in Lok sabha IN DRAFT is The hosting of Various GoI offices and Foreign Dignitaries in NCT territory ,which suffices the given fact that most of the groundwork regarding their safety ,damage control in situation of disaster and Public management is handled by Public officers.If the GoI with Higher Importance than NCT Government is also sitting in the territory,Public officers should be under the GoI rather than Delhi Government.</li>
                        <li>Nonetheless,the power to call a meeting for the newly formed committee is given to Chief minister of Delhi,who happens to be the ex-officio chairperson of the committee,hence giving him a veto power for Expulsion of officers.Hence without his consent No officer can be removed from post.</li>
                        <li>The problem arises during Transfer or Hiring of officers.3 membered committee with 2 of them Central-appointed officers.GoI has a upperhand in this thing despite cm being the chairperson.
                        </li>
                        <li>Clearly,despite this bill ,Union territory of delhi Government has the largest autonomy over all other Union territories of India.If President wants ,accordance with the constitution,he can take control of whole government of UT with a single notification in gazette and transfer all power to GoI,hence it is in his discretization to give how much power to which UT
                        </li>
                        <li>To prevent these things in future,GoI should make a common governing code for all the union territories.</li>
                    </ul>
