              Women in rural India have been living in dire lack of sanitation
              and adequate health facilities. When tied with other elementary
              facilities like education and hygiene awareness, the condition is
              unspeakably distorted. The 2011 United Nations Development
              Programme's Human Development Report ranked India 132 out of 187
              in terms of gender inequality. More than 52% of Indian rural women
              dwell in insufficiency of menstrual sanitation, post-natal care,
              sex education and more.

              A paper titled “Women’s role in sanitation decision making in
              rural coastal Odisha, India” published in PLoS One discusses a
              stark variation in gender ratio in domestic decision making in the
              rural households of Odisha; In comparison to almost 80% men, only
              10% women were given a say in deciding and asking for the
              construction of toilets in their houses

            <h3>
              Long-ridden stereotypes and unreasonable customs being imposed on
              women.
            </h3>
            <p>
              Taboos associated with menstruations, social restrictions on women
              in terms of having access wo clean drinking water, proper
              nutrition and using toilets both in public and at homes are the
              reason why of the 355 million girls that reached their menarche by
              2016, as many as 71 percent did not have basic menstrual awareness
              and knowledge of the changes happening to their bodies.[3] Early
              marriage and enforced reproductive activity adds to the gravity of
              this issue, according to UNICEF, about 240 million women alive in
              India today were married before the age of 18.
            </p>
            <h3>Lack of Education</h3>
            <p>
              Around 23 million girls drop out of primary education in India due
              to ack of proper menstrual hygiene facility in schools and safety
              against teenage harassment and assault. As per the population
              census of 2011, the male to female ratio in India was 940:100,
              with major variations in states like Haryana, Rajasthan and
              Northern India. Of these, India has an adolescent population of
              around 190 million with a 30% illiteracy rate.

            <h3>Lack of hygiene and health facilities</h3>
            <p>
              According to a report by IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics,
              in rural areas, to seek OPD treatment 32 per cent of rural
              respondents had to travel over 5 kms while in urban areas only 8%
              of the total population has to travel more than 5 kms to get basic
              health aid. The difference seems much bigger when we consider the
              percentage difference of rural to urban population in India to be
              around 72%-28%.
            </p>
            <h2>Analysis Methodology</h2>
            <p>
              In this article we will analyze the current demographics of
              women’s healthcare and hygiene in rural India based on currently
              available information and predictions on the following objectives:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Addressing healthcare concerns of women in rural India and
                comparing the to facilities available in the urban counterparts.
              </li>
              <li>
                Analyzing the menstrual health and sexual health scenario of
                women in rural India.
              </li>
              <li>Healthcare awareness and government schemes.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Analysis</h2>
            <p>
              According to research by the SmileFoundation India, “75% of the
              healthcare infrastructure is concentrated in urban areas where
              only 27% of the total Indian population is living” “According to a
              KMPG report, “74% of Indian doctors are catering to the needs of
              the urban population.”

              The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has introduced a scheme
              for promotion of menstrual hygiene among adolescent girls in the
              age group of 10-19 year in rural areas. The major objectives of
              the scheme are:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                To increase awareness among adolescent girls on Menstrual
                Hygiene
              </li>
              <li>
                To increase access to and use of high-quality sanitary napkins
                to adolescent girls in rural areas.
              </li>
              <li>
                To ensure safe disposal of Sanitary Napkins in an
                environmentally friendly manner.
              </li>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
              Even though the status of women’s health and hygiene
              infrastructure in India has largely improved in the past few
              decades, the condition remains far from ideal as a large
              proportion of Indian women, especially from rural and tribal
              regions suffer lack of fundamental healthcare and gender specific
              treatment infrastructure. The stigma associated with girl
              childbirth and preference of boy child in rural India has made
              sex-selective abortion one of the most prealent health crime
              against Indian women. Other health hazards such as cardiovascular
              diseases, HIV/AIDS, maternal health, malnutrition, breast cancer,
              UTIs etc and socio-human issues like lack of education, domestic
              violence, cultural backwardness have prevented women from gaining
              adequate awareness of their rights and benefit from government
              schemes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Resources such as midwives, qualified doctors, or ambulances are
              not readily available at all hospitals; especially in rural
              India.It is important to understand the present need of health
              infrastructure in rural India and revolutionize a more
              comprehensive reform system in healthcare with proper reservation
              for maternal care and women welfare.
